Each dawlf is born with a gem-like object disconnected yet stuck tightly in one of their limbs, which grows alongside the dawlf through their life.
## Appearance
This gem is made of a smooth, bone-like material and is the same color as the pupil of the eye closest to it.
    Ex: If it's bright red and on the right arm, the right eye's pupil will be the one colored bright red.

The gem can take many shapes and sizes, it's a built in accessory of the dawlf and some are very prideful of it's shape, color, or shininess.

However, dawlf gems trend to have two distinct characteristics:
- Organic shapes
- Bright colors
## Purpose
The purpose of this gem is twofold, it channels the magical powers of the dawlf, as well as containing their life-force. It's a somewhat delicate place on a dawlf's body despite how difficult it is to break it.

However, in the case of it breaking, it releases a violent explosion of the dawlf's concentrated elemental magic, killing the dawlf in the process.
