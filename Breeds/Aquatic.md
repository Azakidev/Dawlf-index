These dawlfs resemble otters, having a much slimmer and quite different look to any other kind of dawlf.

These dawlfs are plantigrade and have replaced their tail by a num, the fingers on their foot paws slightly joined by a piece of skin to aid in swimming. They are local to the small costal village of Sulare, lining the coasts of the [[Vileria lizem]].

## Origins
These dawlfs evolved from a group of [[regular]] dawlfs that traveled by sea in an age known for the exploration and colonizing of Laraybis, assumed to shipwreck into the [[Vileria lizem]] and evolved to survive and thrive in the harsh conditions of a seaside climate, known to be dangerous for dawlfs as they're unable to swim because of their tails.
May explain why they lost their tails, having a nub instead.
