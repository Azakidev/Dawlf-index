Bastard dawlfs are the result of crossbreeding between a [[royal]] and a [[regular]] dawlf. They're often unstable in form and trend to live less than the others.
They're not considered a breed by itself, as it's only used in the first couple of generations, if the bastard dawlf even lasts that long, before eventually leading to a [[royal]], [[giant]], or [[regular]] dawlf.
