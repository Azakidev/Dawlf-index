## Landmarks and points of interest
- The Emperor palace
	While called a palace, the emperors don't live there as it's a remnant of the monarchy that came before them. It has since been adapted into the workplace of most of the court, leaving some areas untouched for historical purposes.
- Queen's museum
	Where most of the relics from the queen's time lay here, plus some artwork made long ago.
- Museum of the new arts
	This museum was built after the Queen's museum got too full, it unified a few smaller galleries into a larger museum.
	It was rather overbuilt, so it often hosts contests and community events.
