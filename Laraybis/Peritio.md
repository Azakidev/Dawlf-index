Peritio is a desertic island, with a much hotter and dryer climate than the rest of the planet. It's home to the more religious communities of dawlfs, people in spiritual retirements and memorials of past times.
## Location
South-east of Quarterrimo.
## Settlements
- Sulare
	Not too far form the Shralama oasis there's a town, somewhat isolated from the rest, with a large tower in the middle.
	The more religious dawlfs live there, tending to the spirits of those who have passed. The people there are surprisingly welcoming, the isolation coming from the desert and the desire to be kept to themselves.

- Shralama oasis
	A small lake with an oasis surrounding it. A popular tourist attraction, especially because of the trading posts located nearby and it's proximity to the train station.
- The tower of spirits
	In the center of the town, the large tower stands tall, visible from anywhere on the island and potentially even from other islands. It is imposing when standing at the base of it, although not many can access it.
