The dolfare liza is a large virgin island, said to be the birthplace of dawlfs as the modern feral counterpart of dawlfs still live there after millions of years, seemingly unchanged.

Dawlfs treat it as a sacred place and are very protective of any and all visitors getting close to it, as it serves them as a reminder of their origins.

	A sanctuary to feral dawlfs. It's placed near a natural spring of water in the middle of a forest, a couple of places to sit down, and not much else. It's the only place in the island, besides the bridge leading up to it, that has been touched by anthro dawlfs.
