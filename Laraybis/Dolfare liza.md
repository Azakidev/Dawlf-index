The dolfare liza is a large virgin island, said to be the birthplace of dawlfs as the modern feral counterpart of dawlfs still live there after millions of years, seemingly unchanged.

Dawlfs treat it as a sacred spot and are very protective of any and all visitors getting close to it, as it serves them as a reminder of their origins.
