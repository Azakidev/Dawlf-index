# Dawlf index
This repository/obsidian vault contains all the information about the dolfare (dawlf) as a species, the world they inhabit, their anatomy, and all of the information about them, including some concept art.

Dawlfs are an open furry species originally designed by me, [FatDawlf](https://azakidev.github.io).
However, contributions to the species is both welcome and encouraged, though it is not guaranteed things will be added.

### Neat, I want one!
Designing a character is a difficult task, and this repository is not meant to be a "how to" guide for making a dawlf. It is instead meant to be a place to consult any and all information about the species.
It may serve as inspiration as to what can be done with the species, letting you familiarize yourself with the anatomy, features, environment, and culture of the species.

I wish you luck in the process of designing a dawlf, and I thank you for considering my humble fantasy species.

### But, how do I contribute?
If you have an idea for the species, you may contact me to discuss it directly, or create an issue or a merge request detailing what exactly would you want to add.

Whenever you're contributing, make sure to use the templates provided and follow the style present in the other entries.

### What is a trait and what is a breed?
Traits are features a specific dawlf may have regardless of their species, such as horns, pouches, and other such things you may see in nature or sci-fi creatures.

Breeds of dawlfs come from the set of features, or lack thereof that make them stand out over the other breeds, they always come together and much broader in scope.

The list of traits a dawlf may have depends on the breed they are, as listed by the "Traits" section in each breed's document.
