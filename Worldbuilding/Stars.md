# Overview
In the universe dawlfs live in, stars are not only the fiery spheres of fire that dot the night sky.
They're avatars for the two gods who exist outside of space and time to the beings inside the universe, two distinct bodies making a single entity.

However, only the avatar body could be considered a living being.
A star's avatar body is slim and tall, their face resembling a mask and their head being a flame of the same color as their planetary form.

## Purpose
They're tasked with the responsibility of guarding the area near their planetary body, marked by everywhere their light shines brighter than any other star.
Stars are also tasked with acting on the behalf of the gods and acting upon their will.

These beings are self aware and have a mind of their own separated from the gods. Alongside they share a "common consciousness" across all stars that listen in and participate as they please, this connection is the way these stars stay in contact with the gods.

## Mortality
Their connection can be severed and stars are **not** immortal, as their planetary and avatar bodies are linked, if any of them get damaged enough, or the planetary form simply ends it's life cycle, then the star will die.
They are still rather difficult to kill since they're effectively deities.

Some stars don't die at the end of their cycle and become black holes. In this rare event, their avatar body becomes corrupt and either fails to project altogether, gets stuck within their own black hole, or goes rouge completely, rejecting the common consciousness and often becoming aggressive.
