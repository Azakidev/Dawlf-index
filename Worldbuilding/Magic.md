The magic in the dawlf universe is split in different categories depending on the user and how it affects the environment around them.

# Affinities
Elemental affinities are the kind of magic where one's soul is in tune with a specific aspect of the world and can therefore affect it.
Dawlfs are born with two affinities, three in case of the [[royal]] dawlfs, however they're not exclusive to them.

Affinities are largely inspired by bending in Avatar: The last airbender. But with a few key differences.

Affinities allow the user to actively control the specific element in their affinity.
However, unlike in Avatar, phase changes and secondary forms of bending (metalbending, lightning generation, and bloodbeding) are not allowed and considered separate affinities.
There are also considerably more affinities than bending forms.

Affinities are personality based. But for dawlfs it is largely affected by genetics and the island they're from.

# Divinities
It's the kind of magic that [[Stars]] use.

It works on a request-reply system between the Star and the gods for a direct modification of the universe.
They're essentially miracles, and therefore only bound by the gods rejecting the request.
